# Student Enrollment Form

This is a simple but powerful **student enrollment form** built with **HTML**, **Bootstrap**, and **plain JavaScript**. It connects to **JsonPowerDB** to let you add, view, and update student records in real-time.

The cool part is how it **automatically checks** if a student's **Roll Number** already exists. If it's a new student, you can save their info. If they're already in the system, the form fills itself out, and you can update their details on the spot.

## ðŸ’¡ Why JsonPowerDB?
I chose **JsonPowerDB** because it's **fast and simple**.  
It's a **schema-free** database, meaning thereâ€™s no need to set up complex tables beforehand.  
It allows direct interaction with the database from JavaScript code, making small projects quick and easy to build.
